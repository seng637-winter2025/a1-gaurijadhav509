# Introduction

We completed this exercise to get real-world experience with exploratory testing, manual scripted testing, and regression testing on a specific System Under Test (SUT). Because we had learnt most of our knowledge in the classroom, now was our opportunity to apply those concepts. We hoped to more effectively detect and fix software defects by combining exploratory testing, which simulates how real users interact with the system, with structured manual testing. We used two software versions, 1.0 and 1.1, to replicate various stages of software development. To keep track of all the issues we discovered, we used JIRA, which allowed us to document and monitor bugs in an organised manner. This hands-on experience provided us with a better grasp of software testing.

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

Our exploratory testing focused mostly on the system's basic functionality. We checked deposits, withdrawals, balance enquiries, and fund transfers to confirm they were functioning properly. We also verified that the system could accurately recognise hardcoded card numbers and PINs during login. In addition, we checked that account balances (for checking, savings, and money market accounts) were correct. Additionally, transaction logging and error handling were tested. Finally, we evaluated the interface's usability, responsiveness, and stability under various scenarios.

# Comparison of exploratory and manual functional testing

For this project, we evaluated the system using both exploratory testing and manual functional testing (MFT). MFT is more structured, with a predetermined set of test cases that assure complete coverage but can be time-consuming. The disadvantage is that if a test case is not defined for a given circumstance, the problem may go undetected.

Exploratory testing, on the other hand, offers greater flexibility. It enabled us to identify unforeseen difficulties that were not part of our established test cases. For example, we uncovered an issue where transfers under $0.50 didn't work—which we wouldn't have found using solely MFT.

Flexibility vs. Structure: Exploratory Testing allows testers to freely explore the system, whereas MFT follows an organised, repeatable method.
Finding Bugs Early vs. Covering Everything: Exploratory testing is effective for swiftly identifying new bugs, whereas MFT guarantees that all scheduled test cases are covered.
Speed vs. Accuracy: Exploratory Testing provides quick feedback, whereas MFT does a more complete, exhaustive review.
Tester Skill: Exploratory testing takes creativity and intuition, whereas MFT is more systematic, so anyone who follows the test cases can execute it.
Ideally, combining both strategies produces the best outcomes by balancing speed, coverage, and accuracy.

Conclusion
Both testing approaches provide something worthwhile to the table. Exploratory testing uncovers unforeseen problems, whereas MFT guarantees all critical features are tested properly.

# Notes and discussion of the peer reviews of defect reports

Most of us were new to testing, so we didn't realise how extensive our reports needed to be. Pair testing proved to be extremely beneficial because one person might identify concerns that the other might miss. To stay organised, we generated a custom Jira report (due to one team member's knowledge), which greatly simplified bug tracking.

One important lesson we learnt was how simple it is to miss minor information. For example, one tester failed to detect that after inputting the incorrect PIN, the system required a second attempt. Fortunately, discussing the problem with another couple helped identify and document this defect.

Prioritising bugs also sparked some intriguing debates. Some concerns, such as inappropriate cash withdrawals, were top priority. Others, including the missing ability to transfer money between two savings accounts, weren’t as clear-cut, so we had team discussions to decide their importance.

# How the pair testing was managed and team work/effort was divided 

For pair testing, we ensured that everyone had the opportunity to perform both roles—one person tested while the other assessed the data. We exchanged roles halfway through, allowing everyone to acquire experience from both perspectives. To ensure fairness, we divided the effort evenly between Manual Scripted Testing and Regression Testing.

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

Like any collaborative endeavour, we had several difficulties, primarily differences in communication styles and collaboration dynamics. If we hadn't handled issues correctly, they could have slowed us down. Another problem was rotating between tester and reviewer positions, which occasionally disrupted our workflow. It took some time to adjust to this.

Exploratory testing was especially difficult because it is not as systematic. Without expertise, it was difficult to determine what to search for. Good communication was helpful—before we began, we all agreed on bug report formatting and standards. This manner, everyone knew what information to provide, making comparing and prioritising concerns much easier.

Overall, this project taught us the value of precise documentation, structured teamwork, and flexibility in testing. Using Exploratory and Manual Functional Testing, we got hands-on experience with different testing approaches and learned how to track and manage defects effectively.

# Comments/feedback on the lab and lab document itself

This lab provided an excellent hands-on experience that allowed us to apply testing ideas in a real-world setting. Exploratory Testing catches unanticipated flaws, whereas Manual Functional Testing ensures systematic, repeatable testing.

What worked well: 1. Pair testing detected more bugs 2. JIRA simplified defect tracking 3.  Regression testing identified software modifications

Challenges: - 1. Uncertainty in issue prioritization 2. Unstructured exploratory testing 3. Switching roles during pair testing disturbed the workflow.

Key takeaways: 1. Focus on detail 2. Use a variety of testing methods for optimal results 3. Clear documentation enhances testing effectiveness.
